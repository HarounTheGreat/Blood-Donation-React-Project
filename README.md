# Blood-Donation

---------------

# "Blood is the most precious gift that anyone can give to another person â€” the gift of life."

## World Health Organization

 Forecasting blood supply is a serious and recurrent problem for blood collection managers: in January 2019, "Nationwide, the Red Cross saw 27,000 fewer blood donations over the holidays than they see at other times of the year." Machine learning can be used to learn the patterns in the data to help to predict future blood donations and therefore save more lives.
